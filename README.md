hash
====

A module containing several hashing functions for the Monkey X programming lanugage.
Most notably: A multi-input MD5 implementation, and a quick rewrite of Java's 'hashCode' command.

[Loosely based on the MD5 implementations provided by the Monkey community.](http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=3483)

Special Thanks (Monkey community members):

* [Goodlookinguy, for his 'logical shift right' code, which this is based on.](http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=1707&post=83963)
* Craig Kiesau, for his original MD5 function written in BlitzBasic.
* Fred, for his original port of Craig's BlitzBasic code.
* Xaron, for his 'Strict' compatible version of Fred's code.
